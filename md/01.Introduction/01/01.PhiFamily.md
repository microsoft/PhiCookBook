# Microsoft's Phi family

The Phi models are the most capable and cost-effective Small Language Models(SLMs) available, outperforming models of the same size and the next size up across a variety of language, reasoning, coding, audio, vision, and  math benchmarks. This release expands the selection of high-quality models for customers, offering more practical choices for composing and building generative AI applications.

The Phi Family started with Phi-1 for Python Code generation, continued to Phi-1.5 /2  based on text and chat completion, Phi-3-mini/small/medium-instruct and Phi-3.5/4-mini-instruct, and developed to Phi-3/3.5-vision for vision, Phi-4 based on strong reasoning, and Phi-3.5-MoE for MoE, and now the full-modal model Phi-4-multimodal. Through high-quality data sets, benchumark can be trained to be comparable to models with larger training parameters.

## Example of Model Selection

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|Customer Need|Task|Start with|More Details|
|Need a model that simply summarizes a thread of messages|Conversation Summarization|Phi-3 / 3.5 text model|Deciding factor here is that the customer has a well defined and straight forward language task|
|A free math tutor app for kids|Math and Reasoning|Phi-3 / 3.5 / 4 text models|Because the app is free customers want a solution that does not cost them on a recurring basis |
|Self Patrol Car Camera|Vision analysis|Phi-3 /3.5 -Vision or Phi-4-multimodal|Need a solution that can work on edge without internet|
|Wants to build an AI based travel booking agent|Needs complex planning, function calling and orchestration|GPT models|Need ability to plan, call APIs to gather information and execute |
|Wants to build a copilot for their employees|RAG, multiple domain, complex and open ended|GPT models + Phi Family |Open ended scenario, needs broader world knowledge, hence a larger model is more suited. You need to chunking the knowledge content, maybe SLM is good for you |
