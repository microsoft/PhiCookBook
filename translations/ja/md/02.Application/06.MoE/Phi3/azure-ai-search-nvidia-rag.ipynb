    "\n",
    "このノートブックでは、NVIDIAのAIモデルとLlamaIndexを活用して強力なRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)パイプラインを構築する方法を示します。NVIDIAのLLMと埋め込みを使用し、それらをAzure AI Searchのベクトルストアに統合し、RAGを実行して検索の品質と効率を向上させます。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 利点\n",
    "- **スケーラビリティ**: NVIDIAの大規模言語モデルとAzure AI Searchを活用して、スケーラブルで効率的な検索を実現。\n",
    "- **コスト効率**: 効率的なベクトルストレージとハイブリッド検索技術で検索と取得を最適化。\n",
    "- **高性能**: 強力なLLMとベクトル化された検索を組み合わせて、より迅速で正確な応答を提供。\n",
    "- **品質**: 関連する取得文書を基にLLMの応答を補強し、高品質な検索を維持。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 前提条件\n",
    "- 🐍 Python 3.9以上\n",
    "- 🔗 [Azure AI Search Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)\n",
    "- 🔗 NVIDIA APIキー (NVIDIA NIMマイクロサービスを通じてNVIDIAのLLMと埋め込みにアクセスするため)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 対応する機能\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA LLMの統合 (使用するモデル: [Phi-3.5-MOE](https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-3_5-moe))\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA埋め込み (使用するモデル: [nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5))\n",
    "- ✅ Azure AI Searchの高度な取得モード\n",
    "- ✅ LlamaIndexを使用した文書インデックス化\n",
