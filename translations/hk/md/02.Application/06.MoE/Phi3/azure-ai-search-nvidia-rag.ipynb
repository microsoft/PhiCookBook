    "\n",
    "在這份筆記中，我們將展示如何利用 NVIDIA 的 AI 模型和 LlamaIndex，建立一個強大的檢索增強生成（RAG）管道。我們會使用 NVIDIA 的大型語言模型（LLM）和嵌入技術，將它們與 Azure AI Search 整合作為向量存儲，並進行 RAG 以提升搜尋的質量和效率。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 優點\n",
    "- **可擴展性**：利用 NVIDIA 的大型語言模型和 Azure AI Search，實現可擴展且高效的檢索。\n",
    "- **成本效益**：透過高效的向量存儲和混合搜尋技術，優化搜尋和檢索成本。\n",
    "- **高性能**：結合強大的 LLM 和向量化搜尋，提供更快、更準確的回應。\n",
    "- **高質量**：透過相關檢索文件，確保 LLM 回應的質量。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 先決條件\n",
    "- 🐍 Python 3.9 或更高版本\n",
    "- 🔗 [Azure AI Search Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)\n",
    "- 🔗 NVIDIA API Key，用於透過 NVIDIA NIM 微服務訪問 NVIDIA 的 LLM 和嵌入技術\n",
    "\n",
    "## 涵蓋的功能\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA LLM 整合（我們將使用 [Phi-3.5-MOE](https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-3_5-moe)）\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA 嵌入技術（我們將使用 [nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5)）\n",
    "- ✅ Azure AI Search 高級檢索模式\n",
    "- ✅ 使用 LlamaIndex 進行文件索引\n",
    "- ✅ 使用 Azure AI Search 和 LlamaIndex 與 NVIDIA LLM 進行 RAG\n",
