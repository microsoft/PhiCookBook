    "\n",
    "在本笔记中，我们将演示如何利用 NVIDIA 的 AI 模型和 LlamaIndex 构建一个强大的检索增强生成（RAG）管道。我们将使用 NVIDIA 的大型语言模型和嵌入，将它们与 Azure AI Search 集成作为向量存储，并通过 RAG 提升搜索质量和效率。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 优势\n",
    "- **可扩展性**：利用 NVIDIA 的大型语言模型和 Azure AI Search，实现可扩展且高效的检索。\n",
    "- **成本效益**：通过高效的向量存储和混合搜索技术优化搜索和检索成本。\n",
    "- **高性能**：结合强大的语言模型与向量化搜索，提供更快、更准确的响应。\n",
    "- **高质量**：通过相关检索文档为语言模型的响应提供依据，确保搜索质量。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 前提条件\n",
    "- 🐍 Python 3.9 或更高版本\n",
    "- 🔗 [Azure AI Search 服务](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)\n",
    "- 🔗 NVIDIA API 密钥，用于通过 NVIDIA NIM 微服务访问 NVIDIA 的语言模型和嵌入\n",
    "\n",
    "## 涉及功能\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA LLM 集成（我们将使用 [Phi-3.5-MOE](https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-3_5-moe)）\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA 嵌入（我们将使用 [nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5)）\n",
    "- ✅ Azure AI Search 高级检索模式\n",
    "- ✅ 使用 LlamaIndex 进行文档索引\n",
