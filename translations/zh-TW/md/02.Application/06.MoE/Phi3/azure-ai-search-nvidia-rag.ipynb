    "\n",
    "在這份筆記中，我們將展示如何利用 NVIDIA 的 AI 模型和 LlamaIndex，建立一個強大的檢索增強生成 (RAG) 管道。我們將使用 NVIDIA 的大型語言模型 (LLM) 和嵌入技術，將它們與 Azure AI Search 整合作為向量存儲，並執行 RAG 以提升搜尋的品質和效率。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 優勢\n",
    "- **可擴展性**：利用 NVIDIA 的大型語言模型和 Azure AI Search，實現可擴展且高效的檢索。\n",
    "- **成本效益**：透過高效的向量存儲和混合搜尋技術，優化搜尋和檢索成本。\n",
    "- **高效能**：結合強大的 LLM 和向量化搜尋，提供更快速且更準確的回應。\n",
    "- **高品質**：透過相關檢索文件，確保 LLM 回應的品質。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 先決條件\n",
    "- 🐍 Python 3.9 或更高版本\n",
    "- 🔗 [Azure AI Search Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)\n",
    "- 🔗 NVIDIA API 金鑰，用於透過 NVIDIA NIM 微服務存取 NVIDIA 的 LLM 和嵌入技術\n",
