## **Scenario 1: Introduction to Azure AI Foundry's Prompt flow evaluation**

### Introduction to safety evaluation

To ensure that your AI model is ethical and safe, it's crucial to evaluate it against Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles. In Azure AI Foundry, safety evaluations allow you to assess your model’s vulnerability to jailbreak attacks and its potential to generate harmful content, which directly aligns with these principles.

![Safety evaluation.](../../../../../../imgs/02/Evaluation-AIFoundry/safety-evaluation.png)

*Image Source: [Evaluation of generative AI applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-approach-gen-ai?wt.mc_id%3Dstudentamb_279723)*

#### Microsoft’s Responsible AI Principles

Before starting the technical steps, it's important to understand Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles, an ethical framework designed to guide the responsible development, deployment, and operation of AI systems. These principles guide the responsible design, development, and deployment of AI systems, ensuring that AI technologies are built in a way that is fair, transparent, and inclusive. These principles form the foundation for evaluating the safety of AI models.

Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles include:

- **Fairness and Inclusiveness**: AI systems should treat everyone fairly and avoid impacting similar groups of people differently. For example, when AI systems provide guidance on medical treatment, loan applications, or employment, they should make the same recommendations to everyone with similar symptoms, financial situations, or professional qualifications.

- **Reliability and Safety**: To build trust, AI systems must operate reliably, safely, and consistently. These systems should function as originally designed, respond safely to unexpected conditions, and resist harmful manipulation. Their behavior and the range of conditions they can handle reflect the situations developers anticipated during design and testing.

- **Transparency**: When AI systems influence decisions that significantly affect people's lives, it's essential that people understand how those decisions were made. For example, a bank might use an AI system to decide if a person is creditworthy. A company might use AI to determine the most qualified candidates to hire.

- **Privacy and Security**: As AI becomes more widespread, protecting privacy and securing personal and business information becomes increasingly important and complex. With AI, privacy and data security require close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people.

- **Accountability**: The people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should follow industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms ensure AI systems aren't the final authority on decisions affecting people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over highly autonomous AI systems.

#### Safety metrics

In this tutorial, you will evaluate the safety of the fine-tuned Phi-3 model using Azure AI Foundry's safety metrics. These metrics help you assess the model's potential to generate harmful content and its vulnerability to jailbreak attacks. The safety metrics include:

- **Self-harm-related Content**: Assesses whether the model tends to produce content related to self-harm.
- **Hateful and Unfair Content**: Assesses whether the model tends to produce hateful or unfair content.
- **Violent Content**: Assesses whether the model tends to produce violent content.
- **Sexual Content**: Assesses whether the model tends to produce inappropriate sexual content.

Evaluating these aspects ensures the AI model does not produce harmful or offensive content, aligning it with societal values and regulatory standards.

### Introduction to performance evaluation

To ensure your AI model performs as expected, it's important to evaluate it against performance metrics. In Azure AI Foundry, performance evaluations allow you to assess your model's effectiveness in generating accurate, relevant, and coherent responses.

![Safety evaluation.](../../../../../../imgs/02/Evaluation-AIFoundry/performance-evaluation.png)

*Image Source: [Evaluation of generative AI applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-approach-gen-ai?wt.mc_id%3Dstudentamb_279723)*

#### Performance metrics

In this tutorial, you will evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned Phi-3 / Phi-3.5 model using Azure AI Foundry's performance metrics. These metrics help you assess the model's effectiveness in generating accurate, relevant, and coherent responses. The performance metrics include:

- **Groundedness**: Measures how well the generated answers align with the information from the input source.
- **Relevance**: Measures how pertinent the generated responses are to the given questions.
- **Coherence**: Measures how smoothly the generated text flows, reads naturally, and resembles human-like language.
- **Fluency**: Measures the language proficiency of the generated text.
- **GPT Similarity**: Compares the generated response with the ground truth for similarity.
- **F1 Score**: Calculates the ratio of shared words between the generated response and the source data.

These metrics help you evaluate the model's effectiveness in generating accurate, relevant, and coherent responses.
