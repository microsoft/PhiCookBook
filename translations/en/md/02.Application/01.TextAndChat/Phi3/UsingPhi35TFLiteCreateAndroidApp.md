# **Using Microsoft Phi-3.5 tflite to create Android app**

This is an Android sample using Microsoft Phi-3.5 tflite models.

## **ðŸ“š Knowledge**

Android LLM Inference API lets you run large language models (LLMs) entirely on-device for Android applications, allowing you to perform a variety of tasks such as generating text, retrieving information in natural language, and summarizing documents. The API supports multiple text-to-text large language models out of the box, so you can integrate the latest on-device generative AI models into your Android apps.

Google AI Edge Torch is a Python library that supports converting PyTorch models into a .tflite format, which can then be executed with TensorFlow Lite and MediaPipe. This enables Android, iOS, and IoT applications to run models fully on-device. AI Edge Torch offers broad CPU support, with initial GPU and NPU support as well. It aims to closely integrate with PyTorch by building on top of torch.export() and providing extensive coverage of Core ATen operators.

## **ðŸª¬ Guideline**

### **ðŸ”¥ Convert Microsoft Phi-3.5 to tflite support**

0. This sample is for Android 14+

1. Install Python 3.10.12

***Suggestion:*** use conda to set up your Python environment

2. Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (please refer to [google ai-edge-torch](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-torch))

***Suggestion:*** Use an Azure Linux VM or a third-party cloud VM to create your environment

3. Open your Linux bash and install the Python libraries

```bash

git clone https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-torch.git

cd ai-edge-torch

pip install -r requirements.txt -U 

pip install tensorflow-cpu -U

pip install -e .

```

4. Download Microsoft-3.5-Instruct from Hugging Face

```bash

git lfs install

git clone  https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct

```

5. Convert Microsoft Phi-3.5 to tflite

```bash

python ai-edge-torch/ai_edge_torch/generative/examples/phi/convert_phi3_to_tflite.py --checkpoint_path  Your Microsoft Phi-3.5-mini-instruct path --tflite_path Your Microsoft Phi-3.5-mini-instruct tflite path  --prefill_seq_len 1024 --kv_cache_max_len 1280 --quantize True

```

### **ðŸ”¥ Convert Microsoft Phi-3.5 to Android Mediapipe Bundle**

Please install mediapipe first

```bash

pip install mediapipe

```

Run this code in [your notebook](../../../../../../code/09.UpdateSamples/Aug/Android/convert/convert_phi.ipynb)

```python

import mediapipe as mp
from mediapipe.tasks.python.genai import bundler

config = bundler.BundleConfig(
    tflite_model='Your Phi-3.5 tflite model path',
    tokenizer_model='Your Phi-3.5 tokenizer model path',
    start_token='start_token',
    stop_tokens=[STOP_TOKENS],
    output_filename='Your Phi-3.5 task model path',
    enable_bytes_to_unicode_mapping=True or Flase,
)
bundler.create_bundle(config)

```

### **ðŸ”¥ Use adb to push the task model to your Android device path**

```bash

adb shell rm -r /data/local/tmp/llm/ # Remove any previously loaded models

adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/llm/

adb push 'Your Phi-3.5 task model path' /data/local/tmp/llm/phi3.task

```

### **ðŸ”¥ Running your Android code**
