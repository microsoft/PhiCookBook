## **Using Phi-4-mini-mm to generate code**

Phi-4-mini builds on the strong coding capabilities of the Phi Family. You can use Prompt to ask coding-related questions. With its enhanced reasoning ability, it offers even stronger coding skills, such as generating projects based on requirements. For example, generating projects according to specifications like:

### **Requirement**

Create a Shopping Cart App

- Create a REST API with the following methods:
    - Retrieve a list of beers using page offset and limit.
    - Get beer details by id.
    - Search for beer by name, description, tagline, food pairings, and price.
- Display a list of products on the main page.
    - Add a search bar to filter products.
    - Navigate to the description page when a user clicks on a product.
- (Optional) Slider to filter products by price.
- Create a shopping cart.
    - Add products to the cart.
    - Remove products from the cart.
    - Calculate the total price of the products in the cart.

### **Sample Code - Python**


```python

import requests
import torch
from PIL import Image
import soundfile
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor, GenerationConfig,pipeline,AutoTokenizer

model_path = 'Your Phi-4-mini-mm-instruct'

kwargs = {}
kwargs['torch_dtype'] = torch.bfloat16

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    torch_dtype='auto',
    _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2',
).cuda()

generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained(model_path, 'generation_config.json')

            Note:

            1. Use Python Flask to create a Repository pattern based on the following structure to generate the files

            ｜- models
            ｜- controllers
            ｜- repositories
            ｜- views

            2. For the view page, please use SPA + VueJS + TypeScript to build

            3. Firstly use markdown to output the generated project structure (including directories and files), and then generate the  file names and corresponding codes step by step, output like this
