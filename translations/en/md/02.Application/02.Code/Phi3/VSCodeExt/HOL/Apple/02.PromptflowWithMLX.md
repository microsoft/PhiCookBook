# **Lab 2 - Run Prompt flow with Phi-3-mini in AIPC**

## **What is Prompt flow**

Prompt flow is a set of development tools designed to simplify the entire development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, and evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and allows you to build LLM apps with production-level quality.

With prompt flow, you can:

- Create flows that connect LLMs, prompts, Python code, and other tools into an executable workflow.

- Debug and iterate your flows, especially interactions with LLMs, with ease.

- Evaluate your flows and calculate quality and performance metrics using larger datasets.

- Integrate testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure the quality of your flow.

- Deploy your flows to the serving platform of your choice or easily integrate them into your app’s codebase.

- (Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by using the cloud version of Prompt flow in Azure AI.

## **Building generation code flows on Apple Silicon**

***Note***: If you haven’t completed the environment setup, please visit [Lab 0 - Installations](./01.Installations.md)

1. Open the Prompt flow Extension in Visual Studio Code and create an empty flow project

![create](../../../../../../../../../translated_images/pf_create.bde888dc83502eba082a058175bbf1eee6791219795393a386b06fd3043ec54d.en.png)

2. Add Inputs and Outputs parameters and add Python Code as a new flow

![flow](../../../../../../../../../translated_images/pf_flow.520824c0969f2a94f17e947f86bdc4b4c6c88a2efa394fe3bcfb58c0dbc578a7.en.png)

You can refer to this structure (flow.dag.yaml) to build your flow

```yaml

inputs:
  prompt:
    type: string
    default: Write python code for Fibonacci serie. Please use markdown as output
outputs:
  result:
    type: string
    reference: ${gen_code_by_phi3.output}
nodes:
- name: gen_code_by_phi3
  type: python
  source:
    type: code
    path: gen_code_by_phi3.py
  inputs:
    prompt: ${inputs.prompt}


```

3. Quantize phi-3-mini

We want to better run SLM on local devices. Generally, we quantize the model (INT4, FP16, FP32)

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct

```

**Note:** the default folder is mlx_model

4. Add code in ***Chat_With_Phi3.py***

```python


from promptflow import tool

from mlx_lm import load, generate


# The inputs section will change based on the arguments of the tool function, after you save the code
# Adding type to arguments and return value will help the system show the types properly
# Please update the function name/signature per need
@tool
def my_python_tool(prompt: str) -> str:

    model_id = './mlx_model_phi3_mini'

    model, tokenizer = load(model_id)

    # <|user|>\nWrite python code for Fibonacci serie. Please use markdown as output<|end|>\n<|assistant|>

    response = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt="<|user|>\n" + prompt  + "<|end|>\n<|assistant|>", max_tokens=2048, verbose=True)

    return response


```

4. You can test the flow by Debugging or Running to check if the generation code works properly

![RUN](../../../../../../../../../translated_images/pf_run.4239e8a0b420a58284edf6ee1471c1697c345670313c8e7beac0edaee15b9a9d.en.png)

5. Run the flow as a development API in the terminal

```

pf flow serve --source ./ --port 8080 --host localhost   

```

You can test it in Postman / Thunder Client

### **Note**

1. The first run takes a long time. It is recommended to download the phi-3 model using the Hugging Face CLI.

2. Considering the limited computing power of Intel NPU, it is recommended to use Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.

3. We use Intel NPU Acceleration to quantize with INT4 conversion, but if you restart the service, you need to delete the cache and nc_workshop folders.
