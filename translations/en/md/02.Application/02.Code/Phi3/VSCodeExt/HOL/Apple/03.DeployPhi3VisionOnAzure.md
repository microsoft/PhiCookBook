# **Lab 3 - Deploy Phi-3-vision on Azure Machine Learning Service**

We use NPU to complete the production deployment of local code, and now we want to integrate PHI-3-VISION to enable generating code from images.

In this guide, we will quickly build a Model As Service Phi-3 Vision service on Azure Machine Learning Service.

***Note***: Phi-3 Vision requires significant computing power to generate content quickly. We need cloud computing resources to support this.


### **1. Create Azure Machine Learning Service**

You need to create an Azure Machine Learning Service in the Azure Portal. For instructions, please visit this link [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources?view=azureml-api-2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources?view=azureml-api-2)


### **2. Select Phi-3 Vision in Azure Machine Learning Service**

### **3. Deploy Phi-3-Vision on Azure**

### **4. Test Endpoint in Postman**

***Note***

1. The parameters you send must include Authorization, azureml-model-deployment, and Content-Type. Check the deployment details to get these values.

2. When sending parameters, Phi-3-Vision requires an image URL. Please refer to the GPT-4-Vision method for sending parameters, for example:

```json

{
  "input_data":{
    "input_string":[
      {
        "role":"user",
        "content":[ 
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "You are a Python coding assistant.Please create Python code for image "
          },
          {
              "type": "image_url",
              "image_url": {
                "url": "https://ajaytech.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/index.png"
              }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "parameters":{
          "temperature": 0.6,
          "top_p": 0.9,
          "do_sample": false,
          "max_new_tokens": 2048
    }
  }
}

```

3. Use the Post method to call **/score**

**Congratulations**! You have completed the quick deployment of PHI-3-VISION and tested how to generate code from images. Next, we can build applications combining NPUs and cloud services.
