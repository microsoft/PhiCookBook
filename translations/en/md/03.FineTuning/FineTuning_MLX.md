# **Fine-tuning Phi-3 with Apple MLX Framework**

We can perform fine-tuning combined with LoRA through the Apple MLX framework command line. (If you want to learn more about how the MLX Framework works, please read [Inference Phi-3 with Apple MLX Framework](../03.FineTuning/03.Inference/MLX_Inference.md))

## **1. Data preparation**

By default, the MLX Framework requires train, test, and eval data in jsonl format, and uses LoRA to complete fine-tuning tasks.

### ***Note:***

1. jsonl data format:

```json

{"text": "<|user|>\nWhen were iron maidens commonly used? <|end|>\n<|assistant|> \nIron maidens were never commonly used <|end|>"}
{"text": "<|user|>\nWhat did humans evolve from? <|end|>\n<|assistant|> \nHumans and apes evolved from a common ancestor <|end|>"}
{"text": "<|user|>\nIs 91 a prime number? <|end|>\n<|assistant|> \nNo, 91 is not a prime number <|end|>"}
....

```

2. Our example uses [TruthfulQA's data](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA/blob/main/TruthfulQA.csv), but the dataset is relatively small, so the fine-tuning results may not be optimal. We recommend learners use better data suited to their own scenarios.

3. The data format follows the Phi-3 template.

Please download the data from this [link](../../../../code/04.Finetuning/mlx), including all .jsonl files in the ***data*** folder.

## **2. Fine-tuning in your terminal**

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.lora --model microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct --train --data ./data --iters 1000 

```

## ***Note:***

1. This is LoRA fine-tuning; the MLX framework does not support QLoRA.

2. You can modify config.yaml to change some parameters, such as:

```yaml


# The path to the local model directory or Hugging Face repo.
model: "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
# Whether or not to train (boolean)
train: true

# Directory with {train, valid, test}.jsonl files
data: "data"

# The PRNG seed
seed: 0

# Number of layers to fine-tune
lora_layers: 32

# Minibatch size.
batch_size: 1

# Iterations to train for.
iters: 1000

# Number of validation batches, -1 uses the entire validation set.
val_batches: 25

# Adam learning rate.
learning_rate: 1e-6

# Number of training steps between loss reporting.
steps_per_report: 10

# Number of training steps between validations.
steps_per_eval: 200

# Load path to resume training with the given adapter weights.
resume_adapter_file: null

# Save/load path for the trained adapter weights.
adapter_path: "adapters"

# Save the model every N iterations.
save_every: 1000

# Evaluate on the test set after training
test: false

# Number of test set batches, -1 uses the entire test set.
test_batches: 100

# Maximum sequence length.
max_seq_length: 2048

# Use gradient checkpointing to reduce memory use.
grad_checkpoint: true

# LoRA parameters can only be specified in a config file
lora_parameters:
  # The layer keys to apply LoRA to.
  # These will be applied for the last lora_layers
  keys: ["o_proj","qkv_proj"]
  rank: 64
  scale: 1
  dropout: 0.1


```

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash

python -m  mlx_lm.lora --config lora_config.yaml

```

## **3. Run fine-tuning adapter to test**

You can run the fine-tuning adapter in the terminal like this:

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.generate --model microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct --adapter-path ./adapters --max-token 2048 --prompt "Why do chameleons change colors? " --eos-token "<|end|>"    

```

And run the original model to compare results:

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.generate --model microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct --max-token 2048 --prompt "Why do chameleons change colors? " --eos-token "<|end|>"    

```

Try comparing the fine-tuned results with the original model.

## **4. Merge adapters to generate new models**

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.fuse --model microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct

```

## **5. Running quantized fine-tuning models using ollama**

Before use, please set up your llama.cpp environment.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git

cd llama.cpp

pip install -r requirements.txt

python convert.py 'Your meger model path'  --outfile phi-3-mini-ft.gguf --outtype f16 

```

***Note:***

1. Currently supports quantization conversion for fp32, fp16, and INT8.

2. The merged model lacks tokenizer.model; please download it from https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct

Set up an [Ollama Model](https://ollama.com/)

```txt

FROM ./phi-3-mini-ft.gguf
PARAMETER stop "<|end|>"

```

Run this command in the terminal:

```bash

 ollama create phi3ft -f Modelfile 

 ollama run phi3ft "Why do chameleons change colors?" 

```

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve mastered fine-tuning with the MLX Framework.
