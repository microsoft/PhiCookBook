## Getting Started

There are several basic examples ready for you to run. You can find them in the samples directory. If you want to jump directly to your preferred language, examples are available in the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- cURL

There is also a dedicated Codespaces Environment for running the samples and models.

![Getting Started](../../../../imgs/01/02/02/GitHub_ModelGetStarted.png)

## Sample Code

Below are example code snippets for some common use cases. For more information about the Azure AI Inference SDK, see the full documentation and samples.

## Setup

1. Create a personal access token  
You don’t need to assign any permissions to the token. Note that the token will be sent to a Microsoft service.

To use the code snippets below, create an environment variable to set your token as the key for the client code.

If you're using bash:  
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  
If you're in PowerShell:  

```
$Env:GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  

If you're using Windows command prompt:  

```
set GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token-goes-here>
```  

## Python Sample

### Install dependencies  
Install the Azure AI Inference SDK using pip (Requires: Python >=3.8):

```
pip install azure-ai-inference
```  
### Run a basic code sample

This sample shows a simple call to the chat completion API. It uses the GitHub AI model inference endpoint and your GitHub token. The call is synchronous.

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name 
model_name = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct"
token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    ],
    model=model_name,
    temperature=1.,
    max_tokens=1000,
    top_p=1.
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Run a multi-turn conversation

This sample demonstrates a multi-turn conversation with the chat completion API. When using the model for a chat application, you need to manage the conversation history and send the latest messages to the model.

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    UserMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    AssistantMessage(content="The capital of France is Paris."),
    UserMessage(content="What about Spain?"),
]

response = client.complete(messages=messages, model=model_name)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Stream the output

For a better user experience, you’ll want to stream the model’s response so the first token appears quickly and you don’t have to wait for long responses.

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    stream=True,
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="Give me 5 good reasons why I should exercise every day."),
    ],
    model=model_name,
)

for update in response:
    if update.choices:
        print(update.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")

client.close()
```  
## JavaScript

### Install dependencies

Install Node.js.

Copy the following lines of text and save them as a file named package.json inside your folder.

```
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@azure-rest/ai-inference": "latest",
    "@azure/core-auth": "latest",
    "@azure/core-sse": "latest"
  }
}
```

Note: @azure/core-sse is only required when streaming chat completion responses.

Open a terminal in this folder and run npm install.

For each of the code snippets below, copy the content into a file named sample.js and run it with node sample.js.

### Run a basic code sample

This sample shows a simple call to the chat completion API. It uses the GitHub AI model inference endpoint and your GitHub token. The call is synchronous.

```
import ModelClient from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";

const token = process.env["GITHUB_TOKEN"];
const endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com";
// Update your modelname
const modelName = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct";

export async function main() {

  const client = new ModelClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(token));

  const response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
      messages: [
        { role:"system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role:"user", content: "What is the capital of France?" }
      ],
      model: modelName,
      temperature: 1.,
      max_tokens: 1000,
      top_p: 1.
    }
  });

  if (response.status !== "200") {
    throw response.body.error;
  }
  console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.content);
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

    }
  });

  if (response.status !== "200") {
    throw response.body.error;
  }

  for (const choice of response.body.choices) {

## FREE Usage and Rate limits for GitHub Models

![Model Catalog](../../../../imgs/01/02/02/GitHub_Model.png)

The [rate limits for the playground and free API usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits) are designed to help you experiment with models and prototype your AI application. To go beyond these limits and scale your application, you must provision resources from an Azure account and authenticate through it instead of using your GitHub personal access token. You don’t need to change anything else in your code. Use this link to learn how to exceed the free tier limits in Azure AI.

### Disclosures

Keep in mind that when interacting with a model, you are experimenting with AI, so errors in content are possible.

This feature has various limits (including requests per minute, requests per day, tokens per request, and concurrent requests) and is not intended for production use.

GitHub Models uses Azure AI Content Safety. These filters cannot be disabled as part of the GitHub Models experience. If you choose to use models through a paid service, please configure your content filters according to your needs.

This service is subject to GitHub’s Pre-release Terms.
