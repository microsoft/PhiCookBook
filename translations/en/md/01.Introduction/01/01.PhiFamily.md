# Microsoft's Phi Family

The Phi models are the most capable and cost-effective Small Language Models (SLMs) available, outperforming models of the same size and even larger ones across various benchmarks, including language, reasoning, coding, audio, vision, and math. This release broadens the range of high-quality models available to customers, providing more practical options for creating and developing generative AI applications.

The Phi Family began with Phi-1 for Python code generation, progressed to Phi-1.5/2 for text and chat completion, Phi-3-mini/small/medium-instruct and Phi-3.5/4-mini-instruct, and evolved into Phi-3/3.5-vision for vision tasks, Phi-4 for advanced reasoning, Phi-3.5-MoE for MoE, and now the fully multimodal model Phi-4-multimodal. With high-quality datasets, these models can be trained to perform comparably to models with significantly larger training parameters.

## Example of Model Selection

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
| Customer Need | Task | Start with | More Details |
| Need a model that simply summarizes a thread of messages | Conversation Summarization | Phi-3 / 3.5 text model | The deciding factor here is that the customer has a well-defined and straightforward language task. |
| A free math tutor app for kids | Math and Reasoning | Phi-3 / 3.5 / 4 text models | Since the app is free, customers want a solution that doesnâ€™t incur recurring costs. |
| Self-Patrol Car Camera | Vision Analysis | Phi-3 / 3.5-Vision or Phi-4-multimodal | Requires a solution that can operate on the edge without internet connectivity. |
| Wants to build an AI-based travel booking agent | Needs complex planning, function calling, and orchestration | GPT models | Requires the ability to plan, call APIs to gather information, and execute tasks. |
| Wants to build a copilot for their employees | RAG, multiple domains, complex and open-ended | GPT models + Phi Family | Open-ended scenario requiring broader world knowledge, so a larger model is more suitable. Chunking the knowledge content may make SLM a good option. |
