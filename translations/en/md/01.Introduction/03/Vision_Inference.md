# **Inference Phi-3-Vision Locally**

Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct enables Phi-3 not only to understand language but also to visually perceive the world. With Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct, we can tackle various visual tasks such as OCR, table analysis, object recognition, image description, and more. Tasks that previously required extensive data training can now be completed easily. Below are related techniques and application scenarios referenced by Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct.

## **0. Preparation**

Please ensure the following Python libraries are installed before use (Python 3.10+ is recommended)

```bash
pip install transformers -U
pip install datasets -U
pip install torch -U
```

It is recommended to use ***CUDA 11.6+*** and install flatten

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Create a new Notebook. To follow the examples, it is recommended to first create the following content.

```python
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoProcessor

model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct"

kwargs = {}
kwargs['torch_dtype'] = torch.bfloat16

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto").cuda()

user_prompt = '<|user|>\n'
assistant_prompt = '<|assistant|>\n'
prompt_suffix = "<|end|>\n"
```

## **1. Analyze the image with Phi-3-Vision**

We want the AI to analyze the content of our images and provide relevant descriptions.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\nCould you please introduce this stock to me?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"


url = "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/767633/nvidiadatacenterrevenuefy2017tofy2024.png"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(prompt, image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, 
                                  skip_special_tokens=True, 
                                  clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

We can get the corresponding answers by running the following script in the Notebook.

```txt
Certainly! Nvidia Corporation is a global leader in advanced computing and artificial intelligence (AI). The company designs and develops graphics processing units (GPUs), which are specialized hardware accelerators used to process and render images and video. Nvidia's GPUs are widely used in professional visualization, data centers, and gaming. The company also provides software and services to enhance the capabilities of its GPUs. Nvidia's innovative technologies have applications in various industries, including automotive, healthcare, and entertainment. The company's stock is publicly traded and can be found on major stock exchanges.
```

## **2. OCR with Phi-3-Vision**

Besides analyzing images, we can also extract information from them. This is the OCR process that previously required writing complex code.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\nHelp me get the title and author information of this book?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"

url = "https://marketplace.canva.com/EAFPHUaBrFc/1/0/1003w/canva-black-and-white-modern-alone-story-book-cover-QHBKwQnsgzs.jpg"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(prompt, image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, 
                                  skip_special_tokens=False, 
                                  clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]

```

The result is

```txt
The title of the book is "ALONE" and the author is Morgan Maxwell.
```

## **3. Comparison of multiple images**

Phi-3 Vision supports comparing multiple images. We can use this model to identify differences between images.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\n<|image_2|>\n What is difference in this two images?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"

print(f">>> Prompt\n{prompt}")

url = "https://hinhnen.ibongda.net/upload/wallpaper/doi-bong/2012/11/22/arsenal-wallpaper-free.jpg"

image_1 = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

url = "https://assets-webp.khelnow.com/d7293de2fa93b29528da214253f1d8d0/news/uploads/2021/07/Arsenal-1024x576.jpg.webp"

image_2 = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

images = [image_1, image_2]

inputs = processor(prompt, images, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

The result is

```txt
The first image shows a group of soccer players from the Arsenal Football Club posing for a team photo with their trophies, while the second image shows a group of soccer players from the Arsenal Football Club celebrating a victory with a large crowd of fans in the background. The difference between the two images is the context in which the photos were taken, with the first image focusing on the team and their trophies, and the second image capturing a moment of celebration and victory.
