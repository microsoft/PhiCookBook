# **Quantizing Phi-3.5 using Apple MLX Framework**


MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple silicon, developed by Apple machine learning research.

MLX is created by machine learning researchers for machine learning researchers. The framework is designed to be user-friendly while still being efficient for training and deploying models. Its design is also conceptually straightforward. Our goal is to make it easy for researchers to extend and improve MLX, enabling rapid exploration of new ideas.

LLMs can be accelerated on Apple Silicon devices through MLX, allowing models to run locally with great convenience.

Currently, the Apple MLX Framework supports quantization conversion for Phi-3.5-Instruct (**Apple MLX Framework support**), Phi-3.5-Vision (**MLX-VLM Framework support**), and Phi-3.5-MoE (**Apple MLX Framework support**). Letâ€™s try it out next:

### **Phi-3.5-Instruct**


```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct -q

```


### **Phi-3.5-Vision**


```bash

python -m mlxv_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct -q

```

### **Phi-3.5-MoE**


```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct  -q

```
