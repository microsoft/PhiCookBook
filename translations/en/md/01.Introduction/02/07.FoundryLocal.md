### Why Choose Foundry Local?

Knowing the benefits of Foundry Local will help you make informed decisions about your AI deployment strategy:

- **On-Device Inference:** Run models locally on your own hardware, cutting costs while keeping all your data on your device.

- **Model Customization:** Choose from preset models or use your own to fit specific needs and use cases.

- **Cost Efficiency:** Avoid recurring cloud service fees by leveraging your existing hardware, making AI more accessible.

- **Seamless Integration:** Connect with your applications through an SDK, API endpoints, or the CLI, with easy scaling to Azure AI Foundry as your requirements grow.

> **Getting Started Note:** This tutorial focuses on using Foundry Local through CLI and SDK interfaces. You'll learn both methods to help you pick the best fit for your use case.

## Part 1: Setting Up Foundry Local CLI

### Step 1: Installation

The Foundry Local CLI is your entry point for managing and running AI models locally. Let’s begin by installing it on your system.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows and macOS

For detailed installation instructions, please see the [official Foundry Local documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/blob/main/README.md).

### Step 2: Exploring Available Models

After installing the Foundry Local CLI, you can check which models are available for your needs. This command will list all supported models:


```bash
foundry model list
```

### Step 3: Understanding Phi Family Models

The Phi Family includes a variety of models optimized for different use cases and hardware setups. Here are the Phi models available in Foundry Local:

**Available Phi Models:** 

- **phi-3.5-mini** - Compact model for basic tasks
- **phi-3-mini-128k** - Extended context version for longer conversations
- **phi-3-mini-4k** - Standard context model for general use
- **phi-4** - Advanced model with enhanced capabilities
- **phi-4-mini** - Lightweight version of Phi-4
- **phi-4-mini-reasoning** - Specialized for complex reasoning tasks

> **Hardware Compatibility:** Each model can be configured for different hardware acceleration (CPU, GPU) depending on your system’s capabilities.

### Step 4: Running Your First Phi Model

Let’s try a practical example. We’ll run the `phi-4-mini-reasoning` model, which is great at solving complex problems step-by-step.


**Command to run the model:**

```bash
foundry model run Phi-4-mini-reasoning-generic-cpu
```

> **First-Time Setup:** When running a model for the first time, Foundry Local will automatically download it to your device. Download time depends on your network speed, so please be patient during the initial setup.

### Step 5: Testing the Model with a Real Problem

Now let’s test our model with a classic logic problem to see how it handles step-by-step reasoning:

**Example Problem:**

```txt
Please calculate the following step by step: Now there are pheasants and rabbits in the same cage, there are thirty-five heads on top and ninety-four legs on the bottom, how many pheasants and rabbits are there?
```

**Expected Behavior:** The model should break down this problem into logical steps, using the fact that pheasants have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs to solve the system of equations.

**Results:**

## Part 2: Building Applications with Foundry Local SDK

### Why Use the SDK?

While the CLI is great for testing and quick interactions, the SDK lets you integrate Foundry Local into your applications programmatically. This opens up possibilities for:

- Building custom AI-powered applications
- Creating automated workflows
- Integrating AI capabilities into existing systems
- Developing chatbots and interactive tools

### Supported Programming Languages

Foundry Local offers SDK support for multiple programming languages to suit your development preferences:

**📦 Available SDKs:**

- **C# (.NET):** [SDK Documentation & Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/sdk/cs)
- **Python:** [SDK Documentation & Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/sdk/python)
- **JavaScript:** [SDK Documentation & Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/sdk/js)
- **Rust:** [SDK Documentation & Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main/sdk/rust)

### Next Steps

1. **Choose your preferred SDK** based on your development environment
2. **Follow the SDK-specific documentation** for detailed implementation guides
3. **Start with simple examples** before building complex applications
4. **Explore the sample code** provided in each SDK repository

## Conclusion
