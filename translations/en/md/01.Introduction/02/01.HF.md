# **Using Phi Family in Hugging Face**


[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a very popular AI community with abundant data and open-source model resources. Various manufacturers release open-source LLM and SLM models through Hugging Face, including Microsoft, Meta, Mistral, Apple, Google, and others.

Microsoft Phi Family has been released on Hugging Face. Developers can download the appropriate Phi Family model based on their scenarios and business needs. Besides deploying Phi PyTorch models on Hugging Face, we also offer quantized models in GGUF and ONNX formats to provide end users with more options.

## **Samples - Inference with Microsoft Phi-4**

- **Installing the transformers library**

```bash

pip install transformers -U

```

- **Running this code in VSCode**

```python

import transformers

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model="microsoft/phi-4",
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": "auto"},
    device_map="auto",
)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I have $20,000 in my savings account, where I receive a 4% profit per year and payments twice a year. Can you please tell me how long it will take for me to become a millionaire? Also, can you please explain the math step by step as if you were explaining it to an uneducated person?"},
]

outputs = pipeline(messages, max_new_tokens=2048)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1])
