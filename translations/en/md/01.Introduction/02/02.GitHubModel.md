For more details about the Models available on GitHub Models, check out the [GitHub Model Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models)

## Models Available

Each model comes with its own playground and sample code

## Getting Started

There are several basic examples ready for you to run. You can find them in the samples directory. If you want to jump directly to your preferred language, examples are available in the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- cURL

There is also a dedicated Codespaces Environment for running the samples and models.

![Getting Started](../../../../../translated_images/en/GitHub_ModelGetStarted.150220a802da6fb6.webp)

## Sample Code

Below are example code snippets for some common use cases. For more information about the Azure AI Inference SDK, see the full documentation and samples.

## Setup

1. Create a personal access token  
You don’t need to assign any permissions to the token. Keep in mind that the token will be sent to a Microsoft service.

To use the code snippets below, create an environment variable to set your token as the key for the client code.

If you're using bash:  
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  
If you're in PowerShell:  

```
$Env:GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  

If you're using Windows command prompt:  

```
set GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token-goes-here>
```  

## Python Sample

### Install dependencies  
Install the Azure AI Inference SDK using pip (Requires: Python >=3.8):

```
pip install azure-ai-inference
```  
### Run a basic code sample

This sample shows a simple call to the chat completion API. It uses the GitHub AI model inference endpoint and your GitHub token. The call is synchronous.

```python
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
model_name = "Phi-4"
token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    messages=[
        UserMessage(content="I have $20,000 in my savings account, where I receive a 4% profit per year and payments twice a year. Can you please tell me how long it will take for me to become a millionaire? Also, can you please explain the math step by step as if you were explaining it to an uneducated person?"),
    ],
    temperature=0.4,
    top_p=1.0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    model=model_name
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Run a multi-turn conversation

This sample demonstrates a multi-turn conversation with the chat completion API. When using the model for a chat application, you need to manage the conversation history and send the latest messages to the model.

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-4"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    UserMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    AssistantMessage(content="The capital of France is Paris."),
    UserMessage(content="What about Spain?"),
]

response = client.complete(messages=messages, model=model_name)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Stream the output

For a better user experience, you’ll want to stream the model’s response so the first token appears quickly and you don’t have to wait for long responses.

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-4"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    stream=True,
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="Give me 5 good reasons why I should exercise every day."),
    ],
    model=model_name,
)

for update in response:
    if update.choices:
        print(update.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")

client.close()
```

## FREE Usage and Rate limits for GitHub Models

![Model Catalog](../../../../../translated_images/en/GitHub_Model.ca6c125cb3117d0e.webp)

The [rate limits for the playground and free API usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits) are designed to help you experiment with models and prototype your AI application. To go beyond these limits and scale your application, you must provision resources from an Azure account and authenticate through that instead of your GitHub personal access token. You don’t need to change anything else in your code. Use this link to learn how to exceed the free tier limits in Azure AI.

### Disclosures

Keep in mind that when interacting with a model, you are experimenting with AI, so content errors may occur.

This feature has various limits (including requests per minute, requests per day, tokens per request, and concurrent requests) and is not intended for production use.

GitHub Models uses Azure AI Content Safety. These filters cannot be disabled as part of the GitHub Models experience. If you choose to use models through a paid service, please configure your content filters according to your needs.

This service is subject to GitHub’s Pre-release Terms.
