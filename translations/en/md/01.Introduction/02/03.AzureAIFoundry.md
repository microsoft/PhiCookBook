### **Running Python Code to call Azure AI Foundry Phi-4**

```python

import os  
import base64
from openai import AzureOpenAI  
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider  
        
endpoint = os.getenv("ENDPOINT_URL", "Your Azure AOAI Service Endpoint")  
deployment = os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT_NAME", "Phi-4")  
      
token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(  
    DefaultAzureCredential(),  
    "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"  
)  
  
client = AzureOpenAI(  
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,  
    azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,  
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview",  
)  
  

chat_prompt = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "can you introduce yourself"
    }
] 
    
# Include speech result if speech is enabled  
messages = chat_prompt 

completion = client.chat.completions.create(  
    model=deployment,  
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=800,  
    temperature=0.7,  
    top_p=0.95,  
    frequency_penalty=0,  
    presence_penalty=0,
    stop=None,  
    stream=False
