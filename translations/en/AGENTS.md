## Project Overview

PhiCookBook is a comprehensive repository of cookbooks containing practical examples, tutorials, and documentation for working with Microsoft's Phi family of Small Language Models (SLMs). The repository showcases various use cases, including inference, fine-tuning, quantization, RAG implementations, and multimodal applications across different platforms and frameworks.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Languages:** Python, C#/.NET, JavaScript/Node.js
- **Frameworks:** ONNX Runtime, PyTorch, Transformers, MLX, OpenVINO, Semantic Kernel
- **Platforms:** Azure AI Foundry, GitHub Models, Hugging Face, Ollama
- **Model Types:** Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Phi-4 (text, vision, multimodal, reasoning variants)

**Repository Structure:**
- `/code/` - Functional code examples and sample implementations
- `/md/` - Detailed documentation, tutorials, and guides  
- `/translations/` - Multi-language translations (50+ languages via automated workflow)
- `/.devcontainer/` - Dev container configuration (Python 3.12 with Ollama)

## Development Environment Setup

### Using GitHub Codespaces or Dev Containers (Recommended)

1. Open in GitHub Codespaces (fastest):
   - Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge in README
   - The container auto-configures with Python 3.12 and Ollama with Phi-3

2. Open in VS Code Dev Containers:
   - Use the "Open in Dev Containers" badge from README
   - The container requires a minimum of 16GB host memory

### Local Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.12 or later
- .NET 8.0 SDK (for C# examples)
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for JavaScript examples)
- Minimum recommended RAM: 16GB

**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PhiCookBook.git
cd PhiCookBook
```

**For Python Examples:**
Navigate to specific example directories and install dependencies:
```bash
cd code/<example-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if requirements.txt exists
```

**For .NET Examples:**
```bash
cd md/04.HOL/dotnet/src
dotnet restore LabsPhi.sln
dotnet build LabsPhi.sln
```

**For JavaScript/Web Examples:**
```bash
cd code/08.RAG/rag_webgpu_chat
npm install
npm run dev  # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
```

jupyter notebook  # Opens browser interface
# Navigate to desired .ipynb file
```

```bash
cd code/<example-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python <script-name>.py
```

### Running .NET Examples

```bash
cd md/04.HOL/dotnet/src/<project-name>
dotnet run
```

Or build the entire solution:
```bash
cd md/04.HOL/dotnet/src
dotnet run --project <project-name>
```

### Running JavaScript/Web Examples

```bash
cd code/08.RAG/rag_webgpu_chat
npm install
npm run dev  # Development with hot reload
```

## Testing

This repository contains example code and tutorials rather than a traditional software project with unit tests. Validation is typically done by:

1. **Running the examples** - Each example should execute without errors
2. **Verifying outputs** - Check that model responses are appropriate
3. **Following tutorials** - Step-by-step guides should work as documented

**Common validation approach:**
- Test example execution in the target environment
- Verify dependencies install correctly
- Check that models download/load successfully
- Confirm expected behavior matches documentation

## Code Style and Conventions

### General Guidelines

- Examples should be clear, well-commented, and educational
- Follow language-specific conventions (PEP 8 for Python, C# standards for .NET)
- Keep examples focused on demonstrating specific Phi model capabilities
- Include comments explaining key concepts and model-specific parameters

### Documentation Standards

**URL Formatting:**
- Use `[text](../../url)` format without extra spaces
- Relative links: Use `./` for the current directory, `../` for parent
- Avoid country-specific locales in URLs (e.g., no `/en-us/`, `/en/`)

**Images:**
- Store all images in the `/imgs/` directory
- Use descriptive names with English characters, numbers, and dashes
- Example: `phi-3-architecture.png`

**Markdown Files:**
- Reference actual working examples in the `/code/` directory
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- Use the ðŸ““ emoji to mark Jupyter notebook links in README

### File Organization

- Code examples in `/code/` are organized by topic/feature
- Documentation in `/md/` mirrors the code structure when applicable
- Keep related files (notebooks, scripts, configs) together in subdirectories

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Fork the repository** to your account
2. **Separate PRs by type:**
   - Bug fixes in one PR
   - Documentation updates in another
   - New examples in separate PRs
   - Typo fixes can be combined

3. **Handle merge conflicts:**
   - Update your local `main` branch before making changes
   - Sync with upstream frequently

4. **Translation PRs:**
   - Must include translations for ALL files in the folder
   - Maintain consistent structure with the original language

### Required Checks

PRs automatically run GitHub workflows to validate:

1. **Relative path validation** - All internal links must work
   - Test links locally: Ctrl+Click in VS Code
   - Use path suggestions from VS Code (`./` or `../`)

2. **URL locale check** - Web URLs must not contain country locales
   - Remove `/en-us/`, `/en/`, or other language codes
   - Use generic international URLs

3. **Broken URL check** - All URLs must return a 200 status
   - Verify links are accessible before submitting
   - Note: Some failures may be due to network restrictions

### PR Title Format

```
[component] Brief description
```

Examples:
- `[docs] Add Phi-4 inference tutorial`
- `[code] Fix ONNX Runtime integration example`
- `[translation] Add Japanese translation for intro guides`

## Common Development Patterns

### Working with Phi Models

**Model Loading:**
- Examples use various frameworks: Transformers, ONNX Runtime, MLX, OpenVINO
- Models are typically downloaded from Hugging Face, Azure, or GitHub Models
- Check model compatibility with your hardware (CPU, GPU, NPU)

**Inference Patterns:**
- Text generation: Most examples use chat/instruct variants
- Vision: Phi-3-vision and Phi-4-multimodal for image understanding
- Audio: Phi-4-multimodal supports audio inputs
- Reasoning: Phi-4-reasoning variants for advanced reasoning tasks

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Azure AI Foundry:**
- Requires an Azure subscription and API keys
- See `/md/02.QuickStart/AzureAIFoundry_QuickStart.md`

**GitHub Models:**
- Free tier available for testing
- See `/md/02.QuickStart/GitHubModel_QuickStart.md`

**Local Inference:**
- ONNX Runtime: Cross-platform, optimized inference
- Ollama: Easy local model management (pre-configured in dev container)
- Apple MLX: Optimized for Apple Silicon

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Issues:**
- Phi models require significant RAM (especially vision/multimodal variants)
- Use quantized models for resource-constrained environments
- See `/md/01.Introduction/04/QuantifyingPhi.md`

**Dependency Conflicts:**
- Python examples may have specific version requirements
- Use virtual environments for each example
- Check individual `requirements.txt` files

**Model Download Failures:**
- Large models may timeout on slow connections
- Consider using cloud environments (Codespaces, Azure)
- Check Hugging Face cache: `~/.cache/huggingface/`

**.NET Project Issues:**
- Ensure .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
- Use `dotnet restore` before building
- Some projects have CUDA-specific configurations (Debug_Cuda)

**JavaScript/Web Examples:**
- Use Node.js 18+ for compatibility
- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall if issues persist
- Check browser console for WebGPU compatibility issues

### Getting Help
