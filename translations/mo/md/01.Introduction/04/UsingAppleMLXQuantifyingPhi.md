# **Quantizing Phi-3.5 using Apple MLX Framework**

MLX is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple silicon, developed by Apple machine learning research.

MLX is created by machine learning researchers for machine learning researchers. The framework is designed to be user-friendly while still efficient for training and deploying models. Its design is conceptually straightforward. We aim to make it easy for researchers to extend and enhance MLX to quickly explore new ideas.

LLMs can be accelerated on Apple Silicon devices through MLX, allowing models to run locally with great convenience.

Now Apple MLX Framework supports quantization conversion of Phi-3.5-Instruct (**Apple MLX Framework support**), Phi-3.5-Vision (**MLX-VLM Framework support**), and Phi-3.5-MoE (**Apple MLX Framework support**). Letâ€™s try it next:

### **Phi-3.5-Instruct**

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct -q

```

### **Phi-3.5-Vision**

```bash

python -m mlxv_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct -q

```

### **Phi-3.5-MoE**

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct  -q

```
