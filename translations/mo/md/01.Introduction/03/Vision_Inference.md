# **Inference Phi-3-Vision in Local**

Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct enables Phi-3 to not only comprehend language but also interpret the world visually. With Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct, various visual tasks such as OCR, table analysis, object recognition, and image description can be tackled effortlessly. Tasks that once demanded extensive data training can now be executed with ease. Below are the techniques and application scenarios associated with Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct.

## **0. Preparation**

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed prior to use (Python 3.10+ is recommended):

```bash
pip install transformers -U
pip install datasets -U
pip install torch -U
```

Using ***CUDA 11.6+*** and installing flatten is advised:

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Create a new Notebook. To complete the examples, it is suggested to first set up the following content:

```python
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoProcessor

model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct"

kwargs = {}
kwargs['torch_dtype'] = torch.bfloat16

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto").cuda()

user_prompt = '<|user|>\n'
assistant_prompt = '<|assistant|>\n'
prompt_suffix = "<|end|>\n"
```

## **1. Analyze the image with Phi-3-Vision**

The goal is for AI to analyze the content of images and provide relevant descriptions.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\nCould you please introduce this stock to me?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"


url = "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/767633/nvidiadatacenterrevenuefy2017tofy2024.png"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(prompt, image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, 
                                  skip_special_tokens=True, 
                                  clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

By running the following script in the Notebook, relevant answers can be obtained:

```txt
Certainly! Nvidia Corporation is a global leader in advanced computing and artificial intelligence (AI). The company designs and develops graphics processing units (GPUs), which are specialized hardware accelerators used to process and render images and video. Nvidia's GPUs are widely used in professional visualization, data centers, and gaming. The company also provides software and services to enhance the capabilities of its GPUs. Nvidia's innovative technologies have applications in various industries, including automotive, healthcare, and entertainment. The company's stock is publicly traded and can be found on major stock exchanges.
```

## **2. OCR with Phi-3-Vision**

Beyond analyzing images, information can also be extracted from them. This process, known as OCR, previously required writing complex code.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\nHelp me get the title and author information of this book?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"

url = "https://marketplace.canva.com/EAFPHUaBrFc/1/0/1003w/canva-black-and-white-modern-alone-story-book-cover-QHBKwQnsgzs.jpg"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(prompt, image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, 
                                  skip_special_tokens=False, 
                                  clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]

```

The output will be:

```txt
The title of the book is "ALONE" and the author is Morgan Maxwell.
```

## **3. Comparison of multiple images**

Phi-3 Vision supports the comparison of multiple images, allowing differences between them to be identified using this model.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\n<|image_2|>\n What is difference in this two images?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"

print(f">>> Prompt\n{prompt}")

url = "https://hinhnen.ibongda.net/upload/wallpaper/doi-bong/2012/11/22/arsenal-wallpaper-free.jpg"

image_1 = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

url = "https://assets-webp.khelnow.com/d7293de2fa93b29528da214253f1d8d0/news/uploads/2021/07/Arsenal-1024x576.jpg.webp"

image_2 = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

images = [image_1, image_2]

inputs = processor(prompt, images, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

The output will be:

```txt
The first image shows a group of soccer players from the Arsenal Football Club posing for a team photo with their trophies, while the second image shows a group of soccer players from the Arsenal Football Club celebrating a victory with a large crowd of fans in the background. The difference between the two images is the context in which the photos were taken, with the first image focusing on the team and their trophies, and the second image capturing a moment of celebration and victory.
