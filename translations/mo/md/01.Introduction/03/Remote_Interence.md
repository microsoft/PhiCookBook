# Remote Inferencing with the fine-tuned model

After training the adapters in the remote environment, you can interact with the model using a simple Gradio application.

### Provision Azure Resources
Set up the Azure Resources for remote inference by running `AI Toolkit: Provision Azure Container Apps for inference` from the command palette. During this process, youâ€™ll be prompted to select your Azure Subscription and resource group.  
![Provision Inference Resource](../../../../../translated_images/command-provision-inference.b294f3ae5764ab45b83246d464ad5329b0de20cf380f75a699b4cc6b5495ca11.mo.png)

By default, the subscription and resource group for inference should align with those used during fine-tuning. The inference process will utilize the same Azure Container App Environment and access the model and adapter stored in Azure Files, which were created in the fine-tuning step.

## Using AI Toolkit 

### Deployment for Inference  
To update the inference code or reload the inference model, execute the `AI Toolkit: Deploy for inference` command. This will synchronize your latest code with ACA and restart the replica.  

![Deploy for inference](../../../../../translated_images/command-deploy.cb6508c973d6257e649aa4f262d3c170a374da3e9810a4f3d9e03935408a592b.mo.png)

Once deployment is successfully completed, the model will be ready for evaluation via the endpoint.

### Accessing the Inference API

Access the inference API by clicking the "*Go to Inference Endpoint*" button in the VSCode notification. Alternatively, the web API endpoint can be found under `ACA_APP_ENDPOINT` in `./infra/inference.config.json` and in the output panel.

> **Note:** It may take a few minutes for the inference endpoint to become fully operational.

## Inference Components Included in the Template
 
| Folder | Contents |
| ------ |--------- |
| `infra` | Contains all configurations needed for remote operations. |
| `infra/provision/inference.parameters.json` | Includes parameters for the bicep templates, used to provision Azure resources for inference. |
| `infra/provision/inference.bicep` | Contains templates for provisioning Azure resources for inference. |
| `infra/inference.config.json` | Configuration file generated by the `AI Toolkit: Provision Azure Container Apps for inference` command, serving as input for other remote commands. |

### Using AI Toolkit to Configure Azure Resource Provision
Set up the [AI Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio).

Provision Azure Container Apps for inference using ` command.

You can find configuration parameters in `./infra/provision/inference.parameters.json` file. Here are the details:
| Parameter | Description |
| --------- |------------ |
| `defaultCommands` | This is the commands to initiate a web API. |
| `maximumInstanceCount` | This parameter sets the maximum capacity of GPU instances. |
| `location` | This is the location where Azure resources are provisioned. The default value is the same as the chosen resource group's location. |
| `storageAccountName`, `fileShareName` `acaEnvironmentName`, `acaEnvironmentStorageName`, `acaAppName`,  `acaLogAnalyticsName` | These parameters are used to name the Azure resources for provision. By default, they will be same to the fine-tuning resource name. You can input a new, unused resource name to create your own custom-named resources, or you can input the name of an already existing Azure resource if you'd prefer to use that. For details, refer to the section [Using existing Azure Resources](../../../../../md/01.Introduction/03). |

### Using Existing Azure Resources

By default, the inference provision use the same Azure Container App Environment, Storage Account, Azure File Share, and Azure Log Analytics that were used for fine-tuning. A separate Azure Container App is created solely for the inference API. 

If you have customized the Azure resources during the fine-tuning step or want to use your own existing Azure resources for inference, specify their names in the `./infra/inference.parameters.json`. Afterward, execute the `AI Toolkit: Provision Azure Container Apps for inference` command from the command palette. This will update existing resources or create any that are missing.

For instance, if you already have an Azure container environment, your `./infra/finetuning.parameters.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
      ...
      "acaEnvironmentName": {
        "value": "<your-aca-env-name>"
      },
      "acaEnvironmentStorageName": {
        "value": null
      },
      ...
    }
  }
```

### Manual Provision  
If you prefer to manually configure Azure resources, you can use the provided bicep files in the `./infra/provision` folders. If you have already set up and configured all the Azure resources without using the AI Toolkit command palette, you can simply enter the resource names in the `inference.config.json` file.

For example:

```json
{
  "SUBSCRIPTION_ID": "<your-subscription-id>",
  "RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME": "<your-resource-group-name>",
  "STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME": "<your-storage-account-name>",
  "FILE_SHARE_NAME": "<your-file-share-name>",
  "ACA_APP_NAME": "<your-aca-name>",
  "ACA_APP_ENDPOINT": "<your-aca-endpoint>"
}
```

It seems you are asking for a translation of the text into "mo," but could you clarify what "mo" refers to? Are you referring to a specific language or dialect? If you can provide more details, I'd be happy to assist!
