## Phi Family in GitHub Models

Welcome to [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models)! Everything is set up and ready for you to explore AI models hosted on Azure AI.

![GitHubModel](../../../../../translated_images/GitHub_ModelCatalog.4fc858ab26afe64c43f5e423ad0c5c733878bb536fdb027a5bcf1f80c41b0633.mo.png)

For more details about the models available on GitHub Models, visit the [GitHub Model Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models).

## Models Available

Each model comes with a dedicated playground and sample code.

## Getting Started

There are several basic examples ready for you to try. You can find them in the samples directory. If you'd like to dive into a specific programming language, examples are available for:

- Python
- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- cURL

Additionally, there is a dedicated Codespaces environment for running the samples and models.

![Getting Started](../../../../../translated_images/GitHub_ModelGetStarted.b4b839a081583da39bc976c2f0d8ac4603d3b8c23194b16cc9e0a1014f5611d0.mo.png)

## Sample Code

Below are code snippets for a few use cases. For further details on the Azure AI Inference SDK, refer to the full documentation and samples.

## Setup

1. Create a personal access token  
You don’t need to assign any permissions to the token. Note that the token will be sent to a Microsoft service.

To use the code snippets below, set up an environment variable to store your token as the key for the client code.

If you're using bash:  
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  
If you're in PowerShell:  
```
$Env:GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  
If you're using the Windows command prompt:  
```
set GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token-goes-here>
```  

## Python Sample

### Install dependencies  
Install the Azure AI Inference SDK using pip (Requires: Python >=3.8):  
```
pip install azure-ai-inference
```  

### Run a basic code sample  
This example shows a basic call to the chat completion API. It uses the GitHub AI model inference endpoint and your GitHub token. The call is synchronous.  
```python
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
model_name = "Phi-4"
token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    messages=[
        UserMessage(content="I have $20,000 in my savings account, where I receive a 4% profit per year and payments twice a year. Can you please tell me how long it will take for me to become a millionaire? Also, can you please explain the math step by step as if you were explaining it to an uneducated person?"),
    ],
    temperature=0.4,
    top_p=1.0,
    max_tokens=2048,
    model=model_name
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```  

### Run a multi-turn conversation  
This example demonstrates a multi-turn conversation with the chat completion API. When using the model for a chat application, you’ll need to manage the conversation history and send the latest messages to the model.  
```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-4"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    UserMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    AssistantMessage(content="The capital of France is Paris."),
    UserMessage(content="What about Spain?"),
]

response = client.complete(messages=messages, model=model_name)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```  

### Stream the output  
For an improved user experience, you can stream the model's response to display the first token early and avoid waiting for long responses.  
```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-4"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    stream=True,
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="Give me 5 good reasons why I should exercise every day."),
    ],
    model=model_name,
)

for update in response:
    if update.choices:
        print(update.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")

client.close()
```  

## FREE Usage and Rate Limits for GitHub Models

![Model Catalog](../../../../../translated_images/GitHub_Model.0c2abb992151c5407046e2b763af51505ff709f04c0950785e0300fdc8c55a0c.mo.png)

The [rate limits for the playground and free API usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits) are designed to help you experiment with models and prototype your AI applications. For use beyond these limits, and to scale your application, you’ll need to provision resources through an Azure account and authenticate from there instead of using your GitHub personal access token. You don’t need to change anything else in your code. Use this link to learn how to exceed the free tier limits in Azure AI.

### Disclosures

When interacting with a model, keep in mind that you’re experimenting with AI, so mistakes in the output are possible.

This feature has various limits (e.g., requests per minute, requests per day, tokens per request, and concurrent requests) and is not intended for production use cases.

GitHub Models employs Azure AI Content Safety. These filters cannot be disabled as part of the GitHub Models experience. If you choose to use models through a paid service, you can configure content filters to suit your needs.

This service is governed by GitHub’s Pre-release Terms.

It seems like you requested a translation to "mo," but "mo" isn't a recognized language code or abbreviation for any known language. Could you clarify or specify the target language you'd like me to translate the text into? For example, is it Maori (mi), Moldovan (Romanian, ro), or something else?
