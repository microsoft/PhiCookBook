# Microsoft's Phi Family

The Phi models are the most capable and cost-effective Small Language Models (SLMs) available, outperforming models of similar size and even larger ones across a range of benchmarks including language, reasoning, coding, audio, vision, and math. This release broadens the selection of high-quality models for customers, providing more practical options for developing generative AI applications.

The Phi Family began with Phi-1 for Python code generation, progressed to Phi-1.5/2 for text and chat completion, Phi-3-mini/small/medium-instruct and Phi-3.5/4-mini-instruct, then expanded to Phi-3/3.5-vision for vision tasks, Phi-4 for advanced reasoning, Phi-3.5-MoE for MoE, and now the full-modal model Phi-4-multimodal. By utilizing high-quality datasets, these models can be trained on benchmarks to rival those with larger training parameters.

## Example of Model Selection

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
| Customer Need | Task | Start With | More Details |
| Need a model that simply summarizes a thread of messages | Conversation Summarization | Phi-3 / 3.5 text model | The deciding factor here is that the customer has a well-defined and straightforward language task. |
| A free math tutor app for kids | Math and Reasoning | Phi-3 / 3.5 / 4 text models | Since the app is free, customers want a solution that doesn't incur recurring costs. |
| Self Patrol Car Camera | Vision Analysis | Phi-3 / 3.5 -Vision or Phi-4-multimodal | A solution is needed that can operate on edge devices without requiring internet access. |
| Wants to build an AI-based travel booking agent | Needs complex planning, function calling, and orchestration | GPT models | Requires the ability to plan, call APIs for information, and execute tasks. |
| Wants to build a copilot for their employees | RAG, multiple domains, complex and open-ended | GPT models + Phi Family | This open-ended scenario requires broader world knowledge, making a larger model more suitable. Chunking the knowledge content may be necessary, and SLM could be a good fit. |

It seems like you may have meant "mo" as a language or abbreviation, but "mo" isn't a recognized language code. Could you clarify what language you want the text translated into? For example, are you referring to MƒÅori, Montenegrin, or something else? Let me know so I can assist you further!
