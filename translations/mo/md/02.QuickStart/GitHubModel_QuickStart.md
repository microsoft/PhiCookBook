## Getting Started

We’ve prepared a few basic examples for you to try out. You can find them in the samples directory. If you want to dive right into your preferred programming language, examples are available in:

- Python
- JavaScript
- cURL

There’s also a dedicated Codespaces Environment for running the samples and models.

![Getting Started](../../../../translated_images/GitHub_ModelGetStarted.b4b839a081583da39bc976c2f0d8ac4603d3b8c23194b16cc9e0a1014f5611d0.mo.png)

## Sample Code 

Below are example code snippets for different use cases. For more details about the Azure AI Inference SDK, refer to the full documentation and samples.

## Setup 

1. Create a personal access token  
You don’t need to assign any permissions to the token. Keep in mind that the token will be sent to a Microsoft service.

To use the code snippets below, set your token as an environment variable for the client code.

If you’re using bash:  
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  
If you’re using PowerShell:  

```
$Env:GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
```  

If you’re using Windows command prompt:  

```
set GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token-goes-here>
```  

## Python Sample

### Install dependencies  
Use pip to install the Azure AI Inference SDK (Requires: Python >=3.8):  

```
pip install azure-ai-inference
```  

### Run a basic code sample  

This example shows a simple call to the chat completion API using the GitHub AI model inference endpoint and your GitHub token. The call is synchronous.  

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name 
model_name = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct"
token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    ],
    model=model_name,
    temperature=1.,
    max_tokens=1000,
    top_p=1.
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```  

### Run a multi-turn conversation  

This example demonstrates a multi-turn conversation with the chat completion API. For chat applications, you’ll need to keep track of the conversation history and send the latest messages to the model.  

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    UserMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    AssistantMessage(content="The capital of France is Paris."),
    UserMessage(content="What about Spain?"),
]

response = client.complete(messages=messages, model=model_name)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```  

### Stream the output  

For a smoother user experience, you can stream the model’s response so that the first token appears early, reducing wait times for longer responses.  

```
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

token = os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com"
# Replace Model_Name
model_name = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(token),
)

response = client.complete(
    stream=True,
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="Give me 5 good reasons why I should exercise every day."),
    ],
    model=model_name,
)

for update in response:
    if update.choices:
        print(update.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")

client.close()
```  

## JavaScript  

### Install dependencies  

Install Node.js.  

Save the following lines as a package.json file in your folder:  

```
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@azure-rest/ai-inference": "latest",
    "@azure/core-auth": "latest",
    "@azure/core-sse": "latest"
  }
}
```  

Note: @azure/core-sse is only required when streaming the chat completions response.  

Open a terminal in this folder and run npm install.  

For each code snippet below, copy the content into a file named sample.js and run it using node sample.js.  

### Run a basic code sample  

This example shows a simple call to the chat completion API using the GitHub AI model inference endpoint and your GitHub token. The call is synchronous.  

```
import ModelClient from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";

const token = process.env["GITHUB_TOKEN"];
const endpoint = "https://models.inference.ai.azure.com";
// Update your modelname
const modelName = "Phi-3-small-8k-instruct";

export async function main() {

  const client = new ModelClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(token));

  const response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
      messages: [
        { role:"system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role:"user", content: "What is the capital of France?" }
      ],
      model: modelName,
      temperature: 1.,
      max_tokens: 1000,
      top_p: 1.
    }
  });

  if (response.status !== "200") {
    throw response.body.error;
  }
  console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.content);
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

  }

  if (response.status !== "200") {
    stream.destroy();
    throw new Error(`Failed to get chat completions, http operation failed with ${response.status} code`);
  }

  const sseStream = createSseStream(stream);

  for await (const event of sseStream) {
    if (event.data === "[DONE]") {
      return;
    }
    for (const choice of (JSON.parse(event.data)).choices) {
        process.stdout.write(choice.delta?.content ?? ``);
    }
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

## FREE Usage and Rate limits for GitHub Models  

![Model Catalog](../../../../translated_images/GitHub_Model.0c2abb992151c5407046e2b763af51505ff709f04c0950785e0300fdc8c55a0c.mo.png)

The [rate limits for the playground and free API usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits) are designed to help you experiment with models and prototype your AI application. For usage beyond these limits and scaling your application, you’ll need to provision resources via an Azure account and authenticate from there instead of using your GitHub personal access token. No other changes to your code are required. Use this link to learn how to exceed the free tier limits in Azure AI.

### Disclosures  

Keep in mind that when interacting with a model, you’re experimenting with AI, so errors in content may occur.

This feature has various limits (including requests per minute, requests per day, tokens per request, and concurrent requests) and is not intended for production use cases.

GitHub Models utilize Azure AI Content Safety. These filters are mandatory and cannot be disabled as part of the GitHub Models experience. If you choose to use models through a paid service, configure your content filters according to your needs.

This service is governed by GitHub’s Pre-release Terms.

It seems like "mo" might refer to a specific language or abbreviation, but it's not clear which language or context you're referring to. Could you clarify what "mo" stands for or provide more details? For example, is it Maori, Montenegrin, or something else?
