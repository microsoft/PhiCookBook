# **Make We Introduce Responsible AI**

[Microsoft Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?WT.mc_id=aiml-138114-kinfeylo) na initiative wey dey try help developers and organizations build AI systems wey transparent, trustworthy, and accountable. Di initiative dey provide guidance and resources to help develop responsible AI solutions wey dey follow moral rules like privacy, fairness, and transparency. We go also check some challenges and beta practices wey dey involved for building responsible AI systems.

## Wetin Microsoft Responsible AI Dey About 

![RAIPrinciples](../../../../../translated_images/RAIPrinciples.bf9c9bc6ca160d33.pcm.png)

**Ethical principles** 

Microsoft Responsible AI dey guided by set of ethical principles like privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and safety. Dem design these principles make sure say AI systems dem develop in correct and responsible way.

**Transparent AI**

Microsoft Responsible AI dey stress how important transparency be for AI systems. This one mean say dem go provide clear explanation of how AI models dey work, and make sure say data sources and algorithms fit open or dem explain dem well.

**Accountable AI** 

[Microsoft Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?WT.mc_id=aiml-138114-kinfeylo) dey promote development of accountable AI systems wey fit show how AI models dey take make decision. This one fit help users understand and trust wetin AI systems dey produce.

**Inclusiveness** 

AI systems suppose design am make e benefit everybody. Microsoft dey try make inclusive AI wey dey consider different perspectives and avoid bias or discrimination.

**Reliability and Safety**

 Ensuring say AI systems reliable and safe na important thing. Microsoft dey focus on building robust models wey go perform steady and avoid harmful outcomes.

**Fairness in AI** 

Microsoft Responsible AI sabi say AI systems fit carry bias if dem train am with biased data or algorithms. Di initiative dey provide guidance to develop fair AI systems wey no go discriminate based on things like race, gender, or age.

**Privacy and security** 

Microsoft Responsible AI dey stress how important to protect user privacy and data security for AI systems. This one include to implement strong data encryption and access controls, and to dey regularly audit AI systems for any vulnerabilities.

**Accountability and responsibility** 

Microsoft Responsible AI dey promote accountability and responsibility for AI development and deployment. This one mean make sure say developers and organizations sabi the potential risks wey dey for AI systems, and dem go take steps to reduce those risks.

## Best practices for building responsible AI systems

**Develop AI models using diverse data sets** 

To avoid bias for AI systems, e important make you use diverse data sets wey represent different perspectives and experiences.

**Use explainable AI techniques** 

Explainable AI techniques fit help users understand how AI models dey take make decisions, and this one fit increase trust for the system.

**Regularly audit AI systems for vulnerabilities** 

Regular audits of AI systems fit help find potential risks and vulnerabilities wey need make dem fix.

**Implement strong data encryption and access controls** 

Data encryption and access controls fit help protect user privacy and security for AI systems.

**Follow ethical principles in AI development** 

Follow ethical principles like fairness, transparency, and accountability fit help build trust for AI systems and make sure say dem develop am in responsible way.

## Using AI Foundry for Responsible AI 

[Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com?WT.mc_id=aiml-138114-kinfeylo) na powerful platform wey allow developers and organizations quickly create intelligent, market-ready, and responsible applications. Below na some key features and capabilities of Azure AI Foundry:

**Out-of-the-Box APIs and Models** 

Azure AI Foundry get pre-built and customizable APIs and models. Dem cover plenty AI tasks, including generative AI, natural language processing for conversations, search, monitoring, translation, speech, vision, and decision-making.

**Prompt Flow** 

Prompt flow for Azure AI Foundry dey enable you create conversational AI experiences. E allow you design and manage conversational flows, make am easier to build chatbots, virtual assistants, and other interactive applications.

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** 

RAG na technique wey combine retrieval-based and generative-based approaches. E dey improve quality of generated responses by using both pre-existing knowledge (retrieval) and creative generation (generation).

**Evaluation and Monitoring Metrics for Generative AI** 

Azure AI Foundry dey give tools to evaluate and monitor generative AI models. You fit check their performance, fairness, and other important metrics to make sure say deployment dey responsible. Plus, if you don create dashboard, you fit use the no-code UI for Azure Machine Learning Studio to customize and generate a Responsible AI Dashboard and associated scorecard based on the [Repsonsible AI Toolbox](https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai/?WT.mc_id=aiml-138114-kinfeylo) Python Libraries. This scorecard go help you share key insights about fairness, feature importance, and other responsible deployment considerations with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

To use AI Foundry with responsible AI, you fit follow these best practices:

**Define the problem and objectives of your AI system**

Before you start development, e good make you clear define the problem or objective wey your AI system wan solve. This one go help you know the data, algorithms, and resources wey you need to build effective model.

**Gather and preprocess relevant data** 

Quality and quantity of data wey you use for training AI system fit affect performance well. So e important make you gather relevant data, clean am, preprocess am, and make sure say e represent the population or problem wey you dey try solve.

**Choose appropriate evaluation** 

Plenty evaluation algorithms dey. E important make you choose the correct algorithm based on your data and problem.

**Evaluate and interpret the model** 

After you don build AI model, e important make you evaluate performance using proper metrics and interpret the results in transparent way. This one go help you find any biases or limitations for the model and make improvements where e need.

**Ensure transparency and explainability** 

AI systems suppose dey transparent and explainable so that users fit understand how dem dey work and how decisions dey take. This one especially important for applications wey get serious impact for human life, like healthcare, finance, and legal systems.

**Monitor and update the model** 

AI systems suppose dey continuously monitored and updated to make sure say dem remain accurate and effective over time. This one need ongoing maintenance, testing, and retraining of the model.

In conclusion, Microsoft Responsible AI na initiative wey dey try help developers and organizations build AI systems wey transparent, trustworthy, and accountable. Remember say responsible AI implementation dey very important, and Azure AI Foundry dey try make am practical for organizations. If we follow ethical principles and best practices, we fit make sure say AI systems dem develop and deploy in responsible way wey go benefit society as whole.
