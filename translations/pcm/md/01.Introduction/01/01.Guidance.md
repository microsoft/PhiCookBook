### Guidance-AI na Phi Models as a Service (MaaS)
We dey bring [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) go the Phi-3.5-mini serverless endpoint wey dey for Azure AI Foundry so outputs go dey more predictable by defining the structure wey match the application. With Guidance, you fit remove expensive retries, and fit, for example, make the model select from pre-defined lists (e.g., medical codes), restrict outputs to direct quotes from provided context, or make am follow any regex. Guidance dey steer the model token by token for the inference stack, dey reduce cost and latency by 30-50%, wey make am unique and valuable add-on to the [Phi-3-mini serverless endpoint](https://aka.ms/try-phi3.5mini).

## [**Guidance-AI**](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) na framework wey dem design to help developers create and deploy AI models efficiently. E dey focus on providing tools and best practices to build robust AI applications. 

When dem combine am with **Phi Models as a Service (MaaS)**, e dey provide powerful solution for deploying small language models (SLMs) wey dey cost-effective and high-performing.

**Guidance-AI** na programming framework wey dem make to help developers control and steer large language models (LLMs) better. E allow precise structuring of outputs, dey reduce latency and cost compared to traditional prompting or fine-tuning methods.

### Key Features of Guidance-AI:
- **Efficient Control**: E enable developers to control how the language model dey generate text, make sure say outputs get high-quality and relevance.
- **Cost and Latency Reduction**: E optimize the generation process make am more cost-effective and faster.
- **Flexible Integration**: E dey work with different backends, including Transformers, llama.cpp, AzureAI, VertexAI, and OpenAI.
- **Rich Output Structures**: E support complex output structures like conditionals, loops, and tool use, e make am easier to generate clear and parsable results.
- **Compatibility**: E allow one Guidance program to run on multiple backends, make flexibility and ease of use better.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Constrained Generation**: Use regular expressions and context-free grammars to guide the model's output.
- **Tool Integration**: Automatically interleave control and generation, for example use a calculator inside a text generation task.

For more detailed information and examples, you fit check out the [Guidance-AI GitHub repository](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance).

### Key Features of Phi Models:
1. **Cost-Effective**: Dem design am make e affordable while still maintaining high performance.
2. **Low Latency**: E perfect for real-time applications wey need quick responses.
3. **Flexibility**: You fit deploy am for different environments, including cloud, edge, and offline scenarios.
4. **Customization**: Models fit get fine-tune with domain-specific data to boost performance.
5. **Security and Compliance**: Dem build am with Microsoft's AI principles, to make sure accountability, transparency, fairness, reliability, safety, privacy, and inclusiveness dey.

### Phi Models as a Service (MaaS):
Phi models dey available through pay-as-you-go billing system via inference APIs, wey make am easy to integrate them into your applications without big upfront costs.

### Getting Started with Phi-3:
To start using Phi models, you fit explore the [Azure AI model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models) or the GitHub Marketplace Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) wey dey offer prebuilt and customizable models. Additionally, you fit use tools like [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) to develop and deploy your AI applications.
