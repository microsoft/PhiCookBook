# **Make una sabi Azure Machine Learning Service**

[Azure Machine Learning](https://ml.azure.com?WT.mc_id=aiml-138114-kinfeylo) na cloud service wey dey make machine learning (ML) project lifecycle faster and easier to manage.

ML professionals, data scientists, and engineers fit use am for dia day-to-day workflows to:
- Train and deploy models.
Manage machine learning operations (MLOps).
- You fit create model for Azure Machine Learning or use model wey dem build from open-source platform like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
- MLOps tools dey help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.

## Who Azure Machine Learning dey for?

**Data Scientists and ML Engineers**

Dem fit use tools to speed up and automate dia day-to-day workflows.
Azure ML get features for fairness, explainability, tracking, and auditability.
Application Developers:
Dem fit integrate models into applications or services without stress.

**Platform Developers**

Dem get access to strong set of tools wey dey backed by durable Azure Resource Manager APIs.
These tools dey allow dem build advanced ML tooling.

**Enterprises**

If dem dey work for the Microsoft Azure cloud, enterprises go benefit from familiar security and role-based access control.
Dem fit set up projects to control who fit access protected data and which operations.

## Productivity for Everybody for the Team
ML projects normally need team wey get different skill set to build and maintain.

Azure ML get tools wey enable you to:
- Work together with your team using shared notebooks, compute resources, serverless compute, data, and environments.
- Develop models wey get fairness, explainability, tracking, and auditability to meet lineage and audit compliance requirements.
- Deploy ML models quick and easy at scale, and manage and govern dem well with MLOps.
- Run machine learning workloads anywhere with built-in governance, security, and compliance.

## Cross-Compatible Platform Tools

Anybody for ML team fit use the tools wey dem prefer to do the job.
Whether you dey run rapid experiments, hyperparameter tuning, build pipelines, or manage inferences, you fit use familiar interfaces including:
- Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Python SDK (v2)
- Azure CLI (v2)
- Azure Resource Manager REST APIs

As you dey refine models and collaborate throughout the development cycle, you fit share and find assets, resources, and metrics inside the Azure Machine Learning studio UI.

## **LLM/SLM in Azure ML**

Azure ML don add plenty LLM/SLM-related functions, wey combine LLMOps and SLMOps to create enterprise-wide generative artificial intelligence technology platform.

### **Model Catalog**

Enterprise users fit deploy different models according to different business scenarios through Model Catalog, and provide services as Model as Service make enterprise developers or users fit access.

![model dem](../../../../translated_images/models.e6c7ff50a51806fd.pcm.png)

The Model Catalog in Azure Machine Learning studio na the hub to discover and use wide range of models wey go enable you to build Generative AI applications. The model catalog get hundreds of models from model providers like Azure OpenAI service, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, Nvidia, Hugging Face, including models trained by Microsoft. Models wey come from providers wey no be Microsoft na Non-Microsoft Products, as Microsoft define am for Microsoft's Product Terms, and dem dey subject to the terms wey come with the model.


### **Job Pipeline**

The core of machine learning pipeline na to split complete machine learning task into multistep workflow. Each step na manageable component wey fit be developed, optimized, configured, and automated individually. Steps dey connect through well-defined interfaces. The Azure Machine Learning pipeline service dey automatically orchestrate all the dependencies between pipeline steps.

When we dey fine-tune SLM / LLM, we fit manage our data, training, and generation processes through Pipeline

### **Prompt flow**


Benefits of using Azure Machine Learning prompt flow
Azure Machine Learning prompt flow get plenty benefits wey dey help users move from ideation to experimentation and, finally, to production-ready LLM-based applications:

**Prompt engineering agility**

Interactive authoring experience: Azure Machine Learning prompt flow dey give visual representation of the flow structure, make users fit easily understand and navigate dia projects. E also dey offer notebook-like coding experience for efficient flow development and debugging.
Variants for prompt tuning: Users fit create and compare multiple prompt variants, wey go help iterative refinement process.

Evaluation: Built-in evaluation flows make users fit assess the quality and effectiveness of their prompts and flows.

Comprehensive resources: Azure Machine Learning prompt flow get library of built-in tools, samples, and templates wey serve as starting point for development, dey inspire creativity and accelerate the process.

**Enterprise readiness for LLM-based applications**

Collaboration: Azure Machine Learning prompt flow support team collaboration, allow multiple users to work together on prompt engineering projects, share knowledge, and maintain version control.

All-in-one platform: Azure Machine Learning prompt flow streamline the whole prompt engineering process, from development and evaluation to deployment and monitoring. Users fit deploy their flows as Azure Machine Learning endpoints and monitor their performance in real-time, making sure everything dey work well and dey improve.

Azure Machine Learning Enterprise Readiness Solutions: Prompt flow use Azure Machine Learning's robust enterprise readiness solutions, providing secure, scalable, and reliable foundation for development, experimentation, and deployment of flows.

With Azure Machine Learning prompt flow, users fit unleash dia prompt engineering agility, collaborate well, and use enterprise-grade solutions for successful LLM-based application development and deployment.


By combining the computing power, data, and different components of Azure ML, enterprise developers fit easily build dia own artificial intelligence applications.
