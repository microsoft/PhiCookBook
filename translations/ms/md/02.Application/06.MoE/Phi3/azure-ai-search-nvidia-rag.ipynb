    "\n",
    "Dalam notebook ini, kami akan menunjukkan cara menggunakan model AI NVIDIA dan LlamaIndex untuk mencipta pipeline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) yang berkuasa. Kami akan menggunakan LLM dan embedding NVIDIA, mengintegrasikannya dengan Azure AI Search sebagai stor vektor, dan melaksanakan RAG untuk meningkatkan kualiti dan kecekapan carian.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kelebihan\n",
    "- **Kebolehskalaan**: Manfaatkan model bahasa besar NVIDIA dan Azure AI Search untuk pengambilan data yang berskala dan cekap.\n",
    "- **Kecekapan Kos**: Optimumkan carian dan pengambilan data dengan stor vektor yang cekap dan teknik carian hibrid.\n",
    "- **Prestasi Tinggi**: Gabungkan LLM yang berkuasa dengan carian bervektor untuk respons yang lebih pantas dan tepat.\n",
    "- **Kualiti**: Kekalkan kualiti carian yang tinggi dengan mendasarkan respons LLM pada dokumen yang relevan yang diambil.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prasyarat\n",
    "- 🐍 Python 3.9 atau lebih tinggi\n",
    "- 🔗 [Azure AI Search Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)\n",
    "- 🔗 Kunci API NVIDIA untuk akses kepada LLM dan Embedding NVIDIA melalui perkhidmatan mikro NVIDIA NIM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ciri-Ciri Yang Diliputi\n",
    "- ✅ Integrasi LLM NVIDIA (kami akan menggunakan [Phi-3.5-MOE](https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-3_5-moe))\n",
    "- ✅ Embedding NVIDIA (kami akan menggunakan [nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5))\n",
    "- ✅ Mod Pengambilan Lanjutan Azure AI Search\n",
    "- ✅ Pengindeksan Dokumen dengan LlamaIndex\n",
