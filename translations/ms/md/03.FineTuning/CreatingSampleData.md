# Generate Image Data Set by downloading DataSet from Hugging Face and associated images


### Overview

This script prepares a dataset for machine learning by downloading the necessary images, filtering out rows where image downloads fail, and saving the dataset as a CSV file.

### Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following libraries installed: `Pandas`, `Datasets`, `requests`, `PIL`, and `io`. You will also need to replace `'Insert_Your_Dataset'` in line 2 with the name of your dataset from Hugging Face.

Required Libraries:

```python

import os
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
```

### Functionality

The script performs the following steps:

1. Downloads the dataset from Hugging Face using the `load_dataset()` function.
2. Converts the Hugging Face dataset to a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation using the `to_pandas()` method.
3. Creates directories to save the dataset and images.
4. Filters out rows where image download fails by iterating through each row in the DataFrame, downloading the image using the custom `download_image()` function, and appending the filtered row to a new DataFrame called `filtered_rows`.
5. Creates a new DataFrame with the filtered rows and saves it to disk as a CSV file.
6. Prints a message indicating where the dataset and images have been saved.

### Custom Function

The `download_image()` function downloads an image from a URL and saves it locally using the Pillow Image Library (PIL) and the `io` module. It returns True if the image is successfully downloaded, and False otherwise. The function also raises an exception with the error message when the request fails.

### How does this work

The download_image function takes two parameters: image_url, which is the URL of the image to be downloaded, and save_path, which is the path where the downloaded image will be saved.

Here's how the function works:

It starts by making a GET request to the image_url using the requests.get method. This retrieves the image data from the URL.

The response.raise_for_status() line checks if the request was successful. If the response status code indicates an error (e.g., 404 - Not Found), it will raise an exception. This ensures that we only proceed with downloading the image if the request was successful.

The image data is then passed to the Image.open method from the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module. This method creates an Image object from the image data.

The image.save(save_path) line saves the image to the specified save_path. The save_path should include the desired file name and extension.

Finally, the function returns True to indicate that the image was successfully downloaded and saved. If any exception occurs during the process, it catches the exception, prints an error message indicating the failure, and returns False.

This function is useful for downloading images from URLs and saving them locally. It handles potential errors during the download process and provides feedback on whether the download was successful or not.

It's worth noting that the requests library is used to make HTTP requests, the PIL library is used to work with images, and the BytesIO class is used to handle the image data as a stream of bytes.



### Conclusion

This script offers a straightforward way to prepare a dataset for machine learning by downloading the necessary images, removing rows where image downloads fail, and saving the dataset as a CSV file.

### Sample Script

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def download_image(image_url, save_path):
    try:
        response = requests.get(image_url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
        image.save(save_path)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to download {image_url}: {e}")
        return False


# Download the dataset from Hugging Face
dataset = load_dataset('Insert_Your_Dataset')


# Convert the Hugging Face dataset to a Pandas DataFrame
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()


# Create directories to save the dataset and images
dataset_dir = './data/DataSetName'
images_dir = os.path.join(dataset_dir, 'images')
os.makedirs(images_dir, exist_ok=True)


# Filter out rows where image download fails
filtered_rows = []
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    image_url = row['imageurl']
    image_name = f"{row['product_code']}.jpg"
    image_path = os.path.join(images_dir, image_name)
    if download_image(image_url, image_path):
        row['local_image_path'] = image_path
        filtered_rows.append(row)


# Create a new DataFrame with the filtered rows
filtered_df = pd.DataFrame(filtered_rows)


# Save the updated dataset to disk
dataset_path = os.path.join(dataset_dir, 'Dataset.csv')
filtered_df.to_csv(dataset_path, index=False)


print(f"Dataset and images saved to {dataset_dir}")
```
